        <h1>Rebirth</h1>
        <p>
            If you're seeing this, I'm already dead. Well, not exactly. What I mean is... the me who is writing this is long gone. See, I believe that when a certain amount of time passes, a person dies. For example, and I think about this a lot... your life as a kid. It's very different from now. You think differently, you act differently, you've gained ideals, or maybe you had some before but they've changed. You're an entirely different person than you were before. So where are you now? The past you. They don't exist anymore. They're dead. The you when you were little slowly but surely died during the time of your transition to the person you are now. And in a year, a month, a day, the you then will be different from the you now. I am aware that by that logic, the you/me will technically be a different person by the second. But thinking about that too much will make my mind shatter. And anyways, the change that you have by the second is too insignificant to consider anyways.

            Ah...

            Another example.

            Say you were given the opportunity to relive your entire life with all the knowledge you know now. You'd take it, wouldn't you? Now, let's say you're given the opportunity to live your life but with no knowledge of your previous life. How about the knowledge of a quarter of your previous life? How about half? If I had to guess, you would refuse all those offers. Why? Because without all of the knowledge, experiences, memories, and ideals you've gained up till this moment, the complete erasure of all of that up till this point would mean, well, death....

            So yeah, by the time you read this collection of all my thoughts, the me writing this, the me talking to you at this moment, will have died and been reborn.

            <h2>Communication</h2>
            I'm not good at communication. Unless it's about something I'm into, I can't really keep a conversation going. I freeze sometimes. And it's hard for me to look people in the eye. Though I am getting better, I still end up in awkward situations where I feel like I wanna shoot myself when talking to strangers. Shyness aside. It's the ---- I'm worried about. I lack experience. So I can't comfort well. I suck at apologies. Asking for things is never my strong suit. I prefer to do things alone. But I'm trying. And I'm learning. I'm confident I can overcome my problem of communication within the next few years.

            <h2>Meticulous</h2>
            The way I think is strange. I'm very strategic. Many people would consider that a good trait. In many ways it is. But for me, it's annoying. A lot of the things I say or do are thought out and calculated. I lack the ability to act on instinct or impulse. "How will this benefit me?" "What will they think if I say this?" "If I say this right now, then later I can use it as ----." When I say Hi it's for a reason, when I say I love you it's for a reason. When I tell her she's special it's to make her love me more. Not because I feel that way but because it feels like I should. NO, I DO FEEL THAT WAY. But my thinking too much makes it feel less genuine. It makes me feel like a manipulator. My ulterior motives aren't meant to hurt the people I love. But what if they do at some point. Would that make me EVIL?

            <h2>Smile</h2>
            I'm blessed with a big smile. This smile appears when I am complimented. This smile appears when I know I'm loved. This smile appears when I see other people happy. THIS same uncontrollable smile appears when I am scared. When I see terror. During grief. In times of despair. I smile in uncomfortable and awkward situations. Despite that I choose to look at it as a blessing rather than a curse. So imagine the pain I felt when they told me they didn't love me, six different times, and not even a grin appeared.

            <h2>LOVE</h2>
            This has been said many times before but, Love is a drug. Personally, I think it's the strongest drug there is. The high you get when exposed to it and the withdrawals you get when it's gone are way more extreme than any drug out there.

            <h2>[withdrawal symptoms]</h2>
            Mood Swings, Restlessness, Loss of Appetite, Obsessive Thinking,
            Social Avoidance, Sleep Problems, Self Harm, etc...

            <h2>Friends</h2>
            In my time I lost six friends.

            The first one betrayed me
            ×
            I betrayed the second in kind
            ×
            The third let me go
            ×
            The fourth wasted my time
            ×
            I pushed the fifth away
            ×
            And broke the sixth trust

            I love you all still—I hope you all thrive.

            <h2>LOVE&HEARTBREAK</h2>
            There are two types of love. There's typical love. → Love that you get from your family. Of course your family will love you. And of course you'll love them back. But that's because you have to. You're family. That type of love is predestined. And then there's true love. Love that you have when you're partnered with a significant other. That love, I find stronger. Because you obtained it through your own efforts. Two hearts unknowing of each other's existence suddenly intertwining to become something great. Something, if well nurtured, unbreakable. But that same love can crumble, die out, rot... shatter... That hope, that happiness, can turn into hate, and despair in a blink of an eye. → Heartbreak

            <h2>Savior</h2>
            I met a girl online. She was around my age. She told me that it was just her and her brother. She constantly reminded me that her brother worked three jobs to keep them afloat. The girl sang to me for a little over an hour and asked for my input. She claimed that she wanted to become a singer to help out her brother, who she clearly looked up to. She asked me if I thought she would become a great singer. Of course, I said yes. She was decent enough. She was very flattered by my answer and told me that she really appreciated it. Shortly after that, she asked me if I could do her a favor. She asked me to kill myself. Then she blocked me. I don't know why she told me that, and I probably never will. I soon found myself thinking, "This world is so evil." Not because of what she said to me, but because of her situation. Of course, there was a possibility that she lied to make a fool out of me. I've seen worse from people. But what she said and how she said it felt genuine. Even if she was lying, I know that somewhere out there, there's someone in that exact same situation. And I hate that. I hate that I can't do anything to help. I hate that people have to go through that in the first place. I don't like seeing people suffer. And it pains me to know that there's nothing I can do to help them. That's why I need to become wealthy. So that no matter the person or their situation, I'll know that I'll be able to save them.
