                                         Communication
I'm not good at communication. Unless its about something I'm into I cant really keep a conversation going. I freeze sometimes. And its hard for me to look people in the eye. Though I am getting better, I still end up in awkward situations where I feel like I wanna shoot myself when talking to strangers. Shyness aside. Its the ---- I'm worried about. I lack experience. So I cant comfort well. I suck at apologizes. Asking for things is never my strong suit. I prefer to do things alone. But I'm trying. And I'm learning. I'm confident I can overcome my problem of communication within the next few years.

                                           Meticulous
The way I think is strange. I'm very strategic. Many people would consider that a good trait. In many ways it is. But for me, its annoying. A lot of the things I say or do are thought out and calculated. I lack the ability to act on instinct or impulse. "How will this benefit me?" "What will they think if I say this?" "If I say this right now then later I can use it as ----." When I say Hi its for a reason, when I say I love you its for a reason. When I tell her she's special its to make her love me more. Not because I feel that way but because it feels like I should. NO, I DO FEEL THAT WAY. But my thinking to much makes it feel less genuine. It makes me feel like a manipulator. My ulterior motives aren't meant to hurt the people I love. But what if they do at some point. Would that make me EVIL?

                                             Smile
I'm blessed with a big smile. This smile appears when I am complimented. This smile appears when I know I'm loved. This smile appears when I see other people happy. THIS same uncontrollable smile appears when I am scared. When I see terror. During grief. In times of despair. I smile in uncomfortable and awkward situations. Despite that I choose to look at it as a blessing rather than a curse. So imagine the pain I felt, when they told me they didn't love me, six different times, and not even a grin appeared.

                                              LOVE
This has been said many times before but, Love is a drug. Personally, I think its the strongest drug there is. The high you get when exposed to it and the withdraws you get when its gone are way more extreme than any drug out there.

           Mood Swings, Restlessness, Loss of Appetite, Obsessive Thinking,
           Social Avoidance, Sleep Problems, Self Harm, etc...

                                           LOVE&HEARTBREAK
There are two types of love. There's typical love. → Love that you get from your family. Of course your family will love you. And of course you'll love them back. But that's because you have to. You're family. That type of love is predestined. And then there's true love. Love that you have when you're partnered with a significant other. That love, I find stronger. Because you obtained it through your own efforts. Two hearts unknowing of each others existence suddenly intertwining to become something great. Something, if well nurtured, unbreakable. But that same love can crumble, die out, rot..shatter... That hope, that happiness, can turn into hate, and despair in a blink of an eye. → Heartbreak
